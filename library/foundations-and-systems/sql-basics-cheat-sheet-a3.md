SQL Basics Cheat Sheet
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language to talk to
databases. It allows you to select specific data and to build
complex reports. Today, SQL is a universal language of data. It is
used in practically all technologies that process data.

matching row, NULLs are returned as values from the second
table.

NATURAL JOIN
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
NATURAL JOIN country;
NATURAL JOIN will join tables by all columns with the same
name.
NATURAL JOIN used these columns to match rows:
city.id, city.name, country.id, country.name
NATURAL JOIN is very rarely used in practice.
CROSS JOIN
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
CROSS JOIN country;
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city, country;
CROSS JOIN returns all possible combinations of rows from
both tables. There are two syntaxes available.

QUERYING SINGLE TABLE
Fetch all columns from the country table:
SELECT *
FROM country;
Fetch id and name columns from the city table:
SELECT id, name
FROM city;
SELECT name
FROM city
ORDER BY rating DESC;
Fetch city names sorted by the rating column
in the DESCending order:
SELECT name
FROM city
ORDER BY rating [ASC];
Fetch city names sorted by the rating column
in the default ASCending order:
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE name LIKE '_ublin';
Fetch names of cities that start with any letter followed by
'ublin' (like Dublin in Ireland or Lublin in Poland):
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE name != 'Berlin'
  AND name != 'Madrid';
Fetch names of cities that are neither Berlin nor Madrid:
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE rating IS NOT NULL;
Fetch names of cities that don't miss a rating value:
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE country_id IN (1, 4, 7, 8);
Fetch names of cities that are in countries with IDs 1, 4, 7, or 8:
FILTERING THE OUTPUT
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE rating > 3;
Fetch names of cities that have a rating above 3:
COMPARISON OPERATORS
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE name LIKE 'P%'
   OR name LIKE '%s';
Fetch names of cities that start with a 'P' or end with an 's':
TEXT OPERATORS
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE population BETWEEN 500000 AND 5000000;
Fetch names of cities that have a population between
500K and 5M:
OTHER OPERATORS
•  avg(expr) − average value for rows within the group
•  count(expr) − count of values for rows within the group
•  max(expr) − maximum value within the group
•  min(expr) − minimum value within the group
•  sum(expr) − sum of values within the group

AGGREGATION AND GROUPING
GROUP BY groups together rows that have the same values in specified columns.
It computes summaries (aggregates) for each unique combination of values.
SUBQUERIES
A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query, or inside another subquery.
There are different types of subqueries.
SET OPERATIONS
Set operations are used to combine the results of two or more queries into a
single result. The combined queries must return the same number of columns and
compatible data types. The names of the corresponding columns can be different.

EXAMPLE QUERIES
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM city;
Find out the number of cities:
SELECT COUNT(rating)
FROM city;
Find out the number of cities with non-null ratings:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_id)
FROM city;
Find out the number of distinctive country values:
SELECT MIN(population), MAX(population)
FROM country;
Find out the smallest and the greatest country populations:
SELECT country_id, SUM(population)
FROM city
GROUP BY country_id;
Find out the total population of cities in respective countries:
SELECT country_id, AVG(rating)
FROM city
GROUP BY country_id
HAVING AVG(rating) > 3.0;
Find out the average rating for cities in respective countries if the average is above 3.0:
UNION
SELECT name
FROM cycling
WHERE country = 'DE'
UNION / UNION ALL
SELECT name
FROM skating
WHERE country = 'DE';
UNION combines the results of two result sets and removes duplicates.
UNION ALL doesn't remove duplicate rows.
This query displays German cyclists together with German skaters:
INTERSECT
SELECT name
FROM cycling
WHERE country = 'DE'
INTERSECT
SELECT name
FROM skating
WHERE country = 'DE';
INTERSECT returns only rows that appear in both result sets.
This query displays German cyclists who are also German skaters at the same time:
EXCEPT
SELECT name
FROM cycling
WHERE country = 'DE'
EXCEPT / MINUS
SELECT name
FROM skating
WHERE country = 'DE';
EXCEPT returns only the rows that appear in the first result set but do not appear
in the second result set.
This query displays German cyclists unless they are also German skaters at the
same time:
SINGLE VALUE
SELECT name FROM city
WHERE rating = (
    SELECT rating
    FROM city
    WHERE name = 'Paris'
);
The simplest subquery returns exactly one column and exactly one row. It can be
used with comparison operators =, <, <=, >,  or  >=.
This query finds cities with the same rating as Paris:
MULTIPLE VALUES
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE country_id IN (
    SELECT country_id
    FROM country
    WHERE population > 20000000
);
A subquery can also return multiple columns or multiple rows. Such subqueries can be
used with operators IN, EXISTS, ALL, or ANY.
This query finds cities in countries that have a population above 20M:
CORRELATED
SELECT *
FROM city main_city
WHERE population > (
    SELECT AVG(population)
    FROM city average_city
    WHERE average_city.country_id = main_city.country_id
);
This query finds countries that have at least one city:
SELECT name
FROM country
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM city
    WHERE country_id = country.id
);
A correlated subquery refers to the tables introduced in the outer query. A correlated
subquery depends on the outer query. It cannot be run independently from the outer
query.
This query finds cities with a population greater than the average population in the
country:
